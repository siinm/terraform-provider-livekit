# livekit_access_token (Resource)

This resource allows you to create and manage access tokens for Livekit.

- The Livekit API does not support deleting tokens, so the `delete` operation is a no-op.
- Updating a token requires replacing it since all fields are required to trigger a new token generation.

For detailed usage and authentication guidelines of the generated authentication tokens, please refer to the [Livekit documentation](https://docs.livekit.io/).


#### Example Usage

```terraform
resource "livekit_access_token" "example_token" {
  room     = "example_room"
  identity = "example_identity"
  valid_for = "1h"
  can_publish = true
  can_publish_data = true
  can_subscribe = true
}
```

#### Schema

##### Required

- `room` (String) The name of the room.
- `identity` (String) The identity for the token to connect to the room.
- `can_publish`      (Boolean)
- `can_publish_data` (Boolean)
- `can_subscribe`    (Boolean)


##### Optional

- `valid_for` (String) The duration for which the token is valid, e.g., `1h`, `1d`, `1w`, etc. Defaults to `1h`.
